Proxy – Privacy Policy

Last Updated: March 23, 2025

1. Introduction

Welcome to Proxy (“the Bot,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any information you share while using our Bot. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it.

2. What Data We Collect

1. User Identifiers

We may temporarily collect your Discord username, avatar URL, user status, and bio for moderation or troubleshooting purposes.

We do not collect or store email addresses, phone numbers, or other sensitive personal information.



2. Server Information

Server IDs, channel IDs, and role information may be processed to ensure the Bot’s features (like adlink bypassing or moderation logs) work correctly.



3. Adlink & Scripting Requests

When you use commands to bypass adlinks or request Roblox scripting codes, we process those links/commands in real time but do not store them afterward.



4. Logs for Troubleshooting

Minimal logs may be generated to help us diagnose errors. These logs do not contain personally identifiable information.

Some external APIs we rely on may automatically log your IP address to process requests (outside our control).




3. How We Use Your Data

1. Providing Bot Features

To bypass adlinks, retrieve Roblox updates, and deliver scripting codes upon request.



2. Moderation & Security

To detect spam or abuse, protect against malicious activity, and maintain a safe environment.



3. Troubleshooting & Improvements

To identify and fix errors, enhance user experience, and develop new features.




4. Third-Party Services

1. External APIs

Proxy integrates with third-party APIs (for example, to fetch Roblox data). We do not control how these services handle data such as IP addresses.

We are not responsible for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party service.



2. Links & Scripts

The Bot may bypass adlinks or retrieve external scripts. We are not responsible for how these external sites or script providers handle user data. Always review their respective privacy policies.




5. Data Retention

1. Short-Term Processing

Data such as adlink URLs or scripting commands are processed in real time and not stored once the action is complete.



2. Minimal Logging

Logs used for troubleshooting are stored only as long as necessary to resolve issues. This may include the URLs you provided and the commands you used in the Bot. Afterward, these logs are deleted or anonymized.




6. User Control

1. Removing the Bot

You can remove Proxy from your Discord server at any time to stop any further data processing.



2. Access & Deletion Requests

Since we do not store personal data long-term, any information we do have is ephemeral. If you have concerns or believe we hold data about you, contact us to request its deletion.




7. Data Security

1. Protecting Your Data

We use reasonable measures (such as secure hosting environments) to protect data we temporarily process.



2. No Guarantee

While we strive to safeguard your information, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure.




8. Children’s Privacy

1. Discord’s Minimum Age

Proxy follows Discord’s minimum age requirement (usually 13+). We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.




9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. The latest version will always be available in our repository. Your continued use of the Bot after any modifications indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
