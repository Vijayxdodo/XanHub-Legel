XanHub Bypasser – Terms of Service

Last Updated: March 23, 2025

1. Introduction

Welcome to XanHub Bypasser (“the Bot,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). By adding or using the Bot in your Discord server, you agree to these Terms of Service (“ToS”).

2. What the Bot Does

Adlink Bypassing: The Bot is designed to simplify your experience by bypassing ad-based links, providing you with a more direct route.

Roblox Scripting Codes & Updates: In addition to bypassing adlinks, the Bot offers commands that provide Roblox scripting codes—useful for learning, building, and enhancing your projects—as well as notifications for Roblox updates.

Note: The Bot is intended solely for providing legitimate Roblox scripting codes and is not intended to supply or promote exploit-related script codes. Additionally, any exploit codes or harmful content provided by external APIs are not our responsibility; if we notice third-party APIs providing harmful content, we will immediately remove them.


3. Data Collection & Privacy

No URL or User Data Storage:
XanHub Bypasser does not store any URLs or personal data such as email addresses, phone numbers, or IP addresses. However, a user's IP address might still be logged by external APIs as part of making a request, and we are not responsible for that.

Temporary Processing:
Any information processed (for example, to bypass an adlink) is handled in real time and is not stored or logged after processing is complete.

Basic Logging:
Minimal logging may occur for troubleshooting purposes, but this information is anonymized and does not include user-identifiable details. We only extract information such as usernames, user avatars, status, and bio for moderation logging and server moderation purposes.


4. Third-Party APIs and Content

Use of Third-Party APIs:
The Bot integrates with various third-party APIs to provide its functionalities, such as retrieving Roblox updates or additional scripting information.

No Responsibility for Third-Party Content:
We are not responsible for the accuracy, reliability, or legality of any data or content obtained from these third-party sources. Users are advised to verify any information independently before relying on it, as we do not control the content provided by external services.


5. User Conduct & Responsibilities

By using the Bot, you agree to:

1. Follow Discord’s Community Guidelines, Roblox’s terms, and all applicable laws.


2. Not use the Bot for any illegal or harmful activities, including harassment, spamming, raiding, or distributing malicious content.


3. Acknowledge that while the Bot bypasses adlinks and provides scripting codes, you are responsible for ensuring that your usage complies with the terms of any linked content or services.


4. Avoid sharing or requesting any sensitive or personally identifiable data through the Bot.



6. Disclaimers

1. Not Affiliated with Roblox or Third-Party Services:
We are an independent service and have no official partnership with Roblox or any third-party API providers.


2. No Guarantee of Service:
XanHub Bypasser is provided “as is” without any warranties regarding performance, reliability, or suitability.


3. Risk Acceptance:
By using the Bot, you acknowledge that bypassing adlinks or relying on external data may occasionally lead to unintended outcomes, and you assume all associated risks.



7. Limitation of Liability

We are not liable for any direct, indirect, or incidental damages arising from your use of the Bot, including issues related to bypassing adlinks or using third-party content. Your use of the Bot is at your own risk, and if you are dissatisfied, your sole remedy is to discontinue using the service.

8. Intellectual Property

Our Code & Branding:
All code, design, and branding related to XanHub Bypasser are our intellectual property. Unauthorized copying, modification, or distribution is prohibited.

User Content:
Any content you generate through the Bot remains your property; however, you grant us a license to process and display that content as needed to operate the Bot.


9. Updates to These Terms

We may update this ToS from time to time to reflect new features, legal requirements, or other changes. The latest version will always be posted, and your continued use of the Bot signifies your acceptance of any modifications.

10. Termination

User Termination:
You may remove XanHub Bypasser from your server or application at any time.

Service Termination:
We reserve the right to discontinue or restrict access to the Bot if you violate these ToS or for any other reason deemed necessary.
